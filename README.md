# SchoolManagement_App
This is a School Management Application with C# Forms and MS SQL Server(ado.net).
We can log in with three different roles to this application. Among these roles, the first one is the manager who is responsible for the management and the teachers in the school. Teachers evaluate and test their students as well publishing the grades. After this process, the system automatically calculates the results and inform students whether they have succeed or failed. Finally, students can access their examination grades and achievement rates according to their class.
